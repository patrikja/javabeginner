# 2014-12-27: Some background, history, core concepts and the first few programs

Programming languages can be classified in different groups called "programming paradigms":
* imperative programming: Fortran, C, Cobol, Assembly
* objectoriented programming: Java, C#, C++, Objective C, 
* functional programming: Haskell, JavaScript, ML, Erlang, Scheme, Lisp
* logic programming: Prolog
* scripting languages: PHP, shell, Perl

Early programming languages include:
* Fortran: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran
* Lisp: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)

Important concepts:
* a program is a precise description of something you want the computer to compute(;-)
** a program can have several forms: source code, machine code, etc.
** source code is a human-readable (text) form of a program
** machine code is a CPU-readable (binary) form of a program
* a CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the core of a computer
** the CPU can only run programs in binary "machine code" form (unreadable for humans)
* a compiler is a translator from source code to (some form of) machine code

We start out with simple examples from Jan Skansholms book Java - steg f√∂r steg: http://skansholm.com/javasteg/
